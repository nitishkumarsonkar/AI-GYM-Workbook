# Project Brief

This document outlines the high-level goals for the AI GYM Workbook project and acts as the root of the "memory bank" graph.

- **Objective:** Deliver an AI-powered exercise planner that balances pre-planned sessions with Gemini-generated recommendations, recording user preferences (mass gain, fat loss, etc.) while enforcing Supabase-backed authentication.
- **Key Outcomes:**
  1. Auth-first UX (sign in/up before home screen).
  2. Supabase-backed workout data with user-specific plans and daily logs.
  3. Gemini-enhanced recommendations tailored to stated goals and recent activity.
  4. Documented architectural knowledge captured via linked context files.
